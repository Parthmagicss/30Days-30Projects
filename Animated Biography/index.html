        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello There ✌️<br><br>
            I'm Parthib Banerjee, a passionate and versatile individual currently pursuing my final year in Computer Science and Engineering at Dr.B.C Roy Engineering Collage. I specialize in full stack web development and have a keen interest in the exciting world of stock trading.<br><br>
            As a full stack web developer, I possess a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks such as React and Angular for building intuitive and interactive user interfaces. On the server-side, I have experience with Node.js and Express, along with databases like MySQL and MongoDB for efficient data management. I am also familiar with version control systems like Git, which aids in collaborative development.<br><br>
            Alongside my technical skills, I have developed a strong analytical mindset and a deep understanding of the stock market. As a stock trader, I actively analyze market trends, company financials, and economic indicators to make informed investment decisions. I keep myself updated with the latest news and constantly refine my trading strategies to adapt to changing market conditions.<br><br>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a thirst for knowledge. I am an avid learner and enjoy exploring new technologies and industry best practices to enhance my skill set. I have also had the opportunity to work on several web development projects, both independently and collaboratively, which has honed my ability to deliver high-quality solutions within deadlines.<br><br>
            Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an enthusiastic problem-solver who loves taking on challenges. I believe in the power of teamwork and effective communication, which have been crucial in my collaborative experiences during internships and hackathons.<br><br>
            Looking ahead, I am excited to leverage my skills in full stack web development and my passion for stock trading to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry. I am open to new opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, learn from industry professionals, and make a positive impact.<br><br>
            If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about technology, trading strategies, or anything related to my fields of interest. Let's build amazing experiences and navigate the dynamic world of finance together!"
